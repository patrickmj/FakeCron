FakeCron allows a plugin to execute tasks periodically without setting up cron on the server.

Based on the PoorMansCron Drupal module: http://drupal.org/project/poormanscron

Usage:

Create a new FakeCron task with the following information (or have your plugin do it behind the scenes):

interval : the time interval between runs
controller : the controller in your plugin
action : the controller action to fire

Then, add the following code to the public theme footer:
fakecron($controller, $action);

That helper will insert a small piece of javascript that will call some AJAX to fire off the action
after the specified interval

FakeCron allows a plugin to execute tasks periodically without setting up cron on the server.

Based on the PoorMansCron Drupal module: http://drupal.org/project/poormanscron
A small bit of javascript checks whether it's time to run the task and fires it off if so.

Usage:

In your plugin's controller, make an action that FakeCron will run after the specified interval
(usually it starts an import process).

Also, reate a new FakeCron task with the following information (or have your plugin do it behind the scenes):

name
description
interval : the time interval between runs in seconds
controller : the controller in your plugin
action : the controller action to fire when its time to run the task
data : optional additional data to pass to your controller action for handling the fakecron run
